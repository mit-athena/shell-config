debathena-shell-config (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have renew aklog rather than "fsid -a" so that it works even if the
    user's home directory is not attached.
  * Have renew kinit for whatever principal one has tickets for, if
    tickets exist; defaulting to ATHENA_USER if one has no tickets,
    and defaulting to USER if ATHENA_USER is not set.  This should
    make it easier to deal with usernames not matching the Athena
    username.
